# Project Overview

This project focused on redesigning the registration and building connection process for the apepÃª app, a condominium management application. The goal was to create a seamless experience that would work for users of all technical abilities.

## The Challenge

The application underwent significant changes in business rules, introducing three new scenarios:

1. New users could now register and use services without a condominium link
2. Residents needed to request profile verification for condominium access
3. Users could link to multiple condominiums

## Process

### User Journey Analysis

We mapped out the user journey to understand how residents would register through QR codes placed in their condominiums. This analysis revealed several points where users needed clear guidance.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

We developed a high-fidelity prototype to ensure users, especially those less familiar with technology, could have a realistic testing experience.

### Usability Testing

We conducted usability tests with 15 users, focusing on:
- Users with limited tech experience
- Elderly residents
- First-time app users

The test script included three main tasks:
1. Complete registration
2. Verify email
3. Request condominium connection

## Solution

Our solution involved distributing unique QR codes in each condominium during implementation. These QR codes would:
- Direct users to download the app
- Pre-fill the condominium information
- Guide users through the verification process
